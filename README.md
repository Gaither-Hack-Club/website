# Gaither Hack Club Website

This is the website for Gaither Hack Club! It's built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com), so the code might seem a little different from the normal HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you're used to. Don't worry though, they build upon the same concepts! Here's a quick overview of the repo structure:

- `public`: Website assets, such as fonts and images.
- `src`: Where all of the actual website code is! All the other files in the root folder are configuration files.
  - `content`: Where all the workshop content is!
  - `images`: More images!
  - `layouts`: Wrapper files containing code used on mutliple pages in the website. There's only one layout used everywhere right now.
  - `pages`: The files for each individual page on the website. `index.astro` is just the homepage.
